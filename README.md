## How It's Made:
**Tech Used**: HTML & CSS

This project was built using Node.js, Express and EJS (Embedded Javascript Templating) for more dynamic programming.

##Lessons Learned:

Prior to completing this project, I had never worked with a JS templating framework and was unsure as to how it was connecting the database to the frontend. After completing this project I feel much more comfortable working with EJS and look forward to working with other templating languages and creating more dynamic CRUD apps.
